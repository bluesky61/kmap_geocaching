##Purpose##
This program draws gpx files onto Korean maps like daum map(http://map.daum.net/) 
and naver map(http://map.naver.com/) as well as google maps.
The gpx files should contain geocaches, made by geocaching pocket query or GDSK.

##Usage##
At first, make personal directories, and then upload gpx files. (max 20 Mb)
That's all. Just move around and the geocaches will appear onto the map.
You can change maps using the buttons in the menu.
